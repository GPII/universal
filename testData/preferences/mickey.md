This preference set enables mouse emulation.

With this setting, the user can control the mouse using the number pad.

## Testing
 
The mouse cursor should move when pressing the directional keys on the number pad (depending on if Num Lock is on).

For testing in a Virtual Machine, mouse integration should be turned off (keyboard focus can be toggled using the "host key", usually the right ctrl).

On a laptop keyboard, Fn may need to be held down or put in keypad mode.
