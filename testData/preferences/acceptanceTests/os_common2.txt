os_common2.json
===============

This NP set is used to check the behaviour under GNU/Linux when highContrastEnabled is set to false.

When logging in with this NP set, GNOME should use its default values for gtk-theme and icon-theme.
So if you want to see this in action:
  1. Manually turn HighContrast on
  2. Log-in as os_common2
  3. GNOME will disable the HighContrast theme
  4. Log-out
  5. HighContrast is enabled again
