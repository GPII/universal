This folder contains the NP sets that are used for acceptance testing.

Each NP set is depended on by an (or several) acceptance test, so they should not be deleted or modified, unless it is ensured that this will not affect the acceptance test(s) in question.

Note that the acceptance tests are located not only in universal, but also in the Linux, Windows and Android repositories.
