# Omnitor's eCmobile/eCtouch preference sets

The following preference sets are used for demonstrating eCmobile/eCtouch:

* `omnitor1.json`: eCmobile's factory settings as common terms
 * default font size
 * high contrast off

* `omnitor2.json`: custom settings as common terms
 * larger text
 * high contrast on
 * use the yellow-black high contrast theme

When logging in/out with these NP sets into a device where eCmobile/eCtouch is installed a user will observe the following sequence:
* eCmobile/eCtouch will be launched
* It will be configured according to the used NP set
* When logging out, the user will be taken to the home screen (even if eCmobile/eCtouch is still running in the background)
