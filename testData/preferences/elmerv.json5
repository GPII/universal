// ## Demo Personas with User Stories
//
// This preference set is part of our set of personas used for the demo install,
// presentations, and in general conveying an array of compelling user stories for
// the GPII.
//
// elmerv is identical to elmer except that it sets the screen to 1280 x 720 (instead of  800 x 600 that ELMER does) which works very well for demoing on the Sony Vaio (which is also the reason for the "v" in elmerv)
//
// ## Details
//
// Elmer  — Low Screen Resolution
//
// Elmer is older and his sight is failing — but magnifiers confuse him.  So he just uses a low screen resolution and everything is larger for him, but nothing moves offscreen like a magnifier would do.
