# Nyx

The preference set enables the night screen, reducing the blue from the screen.

## Testing

To see the results, a physical machine is required. When enabled, the blue is reduced (making white turn yellow).

For a VM, search for "night light" in System Settings. The button will say `Turn on now` if this setting is disabled,
otherwise `Turn off now`.
