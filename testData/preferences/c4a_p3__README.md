# Needs and Preference Sets for Cloud4all Pilot 3

The preference sets listed below were created for use in auto-configuration use cases in  Cloud4all's third pilot. The naming convention (file names starting with "c4a_p3_") are meant to make this relation obvious.

* c4a_p3_john.json (use case 1: Windows + NVDA; Fedora 21 + Orca; Android + Mobile Accessibility for Android),
* c4a_p3_martha.json (use case 2: Windows 7; ticket vending machine; mobile with Java ME),
* c4a_p3_vladimir.json (use case 3: screen reader user with low vision: Windows 7 and SuperNova, DTV audiodescription, Android tablet),
* c4a_p3_peter.json (use case 4: DTV only),
* c4a_p3_maria.json (use case 5: EasyOne Communicator on Linux; Maavis on Windows),
* c4a_p3_paul.json (use case 6: Windows 7; mobile with Java ME),
* c4a_p3_michael.json (use case 7: Read&Write Gold; Cloud4Chrome),
* c4a_p3_katia.json (use case 8: Windows 7; native Android phone),
