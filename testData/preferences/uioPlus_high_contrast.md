# uioPlus_high_contrast

A preference set for testing preference settings in the UIO+ browser extension.

Applies the Highlight Contrast theme preference. The contrast of the page will be set to match the specified contrast theme. Unless a site provides it's own themed versions (most likely only pages that already support UIO), images will remain unaffected.
