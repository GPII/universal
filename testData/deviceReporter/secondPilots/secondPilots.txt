The configuration files in this folder were used for the second round of pilot testing in the Cloud4All project.

Each configuration file sets up a machine according to some scenario that should be tested in the second pilots phase - these files are used instead of the dynamic device reporter to statically report what's "installed" on the machine.

The machines were 'configured' by using a configuration tool (web page - https://github.com/Cloud4AllTUD/pilotsConfig), which would replace the static device reporter file that was used by GPII with the relevant one from this folder.

To make sense of the use case of each device reporter file, see
