This folder contains the DB data that is used for running GPII in different configurations. They are loaded into CouchDB:

1. When GPII runs in a development configuration or when running GPII integration tests.
2. When GPII runs in a production or staging configuration.

Each data file corresponds to a document structure specified in the [GPII Data Model](https://wiki.gpii.net/w/Keys,_KeyTokens,_and_Preferences) documentation:

* clientCredentials.json: Contains OAuth2 client credentials.
* gpiiAppInstallationClients.json: Contains the information of all registered GPII app installations.
* views.json: The CouchDB "_design/views" functions.

Additional preferences DB data are found elsewhere and used in conjunction with the files in this folder.  The
preferences files located in %universal/testData/preferences/ are converted into both "snapset" and "user" preferences.
The following "snapset" folder contains snapset PrefsSafes and GPII keys for (1) running GPII in production and staging
GPII configurations where the data is loaded into CouchDB, and (2) running GPII in its development configuration where
the data is loaded into the local CouchDB:

* %universal/build/dbData/snapset/gpiiKeys.json
* %universal/build/dbData/snapset/prefsSafes.json

The following "user" folder contains writable "user" data, loaded into a local CouchDB instance when running GPII
integration tests:

* %universal/build/dbData/user/gpiiKeys.json
* %universal/build/dbData/user/prefsSafes.json
