## Description

Morphic QuickStrip is built on top of the GPII and is the result of the APCP project.
It consists in a GUI running on electron that presents a bar that the user can use
to deal with different settings. At this moment, Morphic only works on MS Windows
and uses the WebSockets settingsHandler to communicate with the GPII.

## Installation

Ask Javier Hernández for an installer. :P

## Testing

For manual testing, you need to login to the GPII with a preference set containing
preferences supported by the Morphic QuickStrip.

_TODO:_ Provide a preference set for manual testing.
