## Description

Read&Write literacy software makes the web, documents and files more accessible - any time, any place, and on any platform or device. It's great for people with dyslexia and other learning difficulties, or anyone whose first language isn't English.

You'll find more information at:

* [Read&Write website](https://www.texthelp.com/en-gb/products/read-and-write-family)

## Integration
The current implementation of Read&Write allows the GPII to:

* Configure the application through the GPII's built-in XML settings handler
* Determine whether Read&Write is installed in the system
* Start and stop the application

Actually it doesn't include any transformation so this implementation only works with application specific settings.

## Testing
When using a NP set that makes use of Read&Write, it should be launched and configured properly by taking into account the settings included in that NP set.
Actually there are two NP sets included into universal (rwg1 and rwg2) with settings for Read&Write and that you can use to test this implementation.

Also, the GPII has [acceptance tests](https://github.com/GPII/universal/blob/master/tests/platform/windows/windows-readwrite-testSpec.txt) for Read&Write.

### rwg1

NP set: [preferences/rwg1.json](https://github.com/GPII/universal/blob/master/testData/preferences/rwg1.json)

* When logging in, Read&Write should be started automatically and among many other adaptations: 
  * The toolbar must use the "Fun" icon set and they should be shown in "large" mode
  * The toolbar must show the "Writing Features" including buttons such as "Spell check", "Prediction", etc.
* When logging out, Read&Write should be stopped and default settings will be restored.

### rwg2

NP set: [preferences/rwg2.json](https://github.com/GPII/universal/blob/master/testData/preferences/rwg2.json)

* When logging in, Read&Write should be started automatically and among many other adaptations:
  * The toolbar must use the "Professional" icon set and they should be shown in "large" mode
  * The toolbar must show the "Reading Features" including buttons such as "Dictionary" and the "Play/Pause/Rewind/Forward".
* When logging out, Read&Write should be stopped and default settings will be restored.
