# GPII Data Model

GPII uses CouchDB to store data in JSON documents.  The two GPII components that read and write data from the data
storage are the Preferences Server and the Authorization Server.

The details of the GPII data model can be found [here](https://wiki.gpii.net/w/Keys,_KeyTokens,_and_Preferences).
