# Install on Demand

Provides the ability to install software on demand.

The stages of installation:

### start

* Gets the package info from the server.
* `requirePackage` finds a suitable `gpii.iod.packageInstaller` for the package.

### initialise
Creates a temporary directory, starts the following pipeline.

### download
Downloads the package.

### check
Checks the downloaded package.

### prepareInstall
Generates the installation commands.

### install
Installs the package.

### cleanup
Cleans the files.


## Parts

### `gpii.iod`

The install on demand component.

### `gpii.iod.packageInstaller`

Base component of the package installers, which perform the work that's specific to the type of package being installed.

Implementations will probably be found in the OS-specific repository.

### `gpii.iod.packageDataSource`

The package data source.

## IoD Server

Using the development config, GPII will provide package data from [testData/installOnDemand](testData/installOnDemand).

But, if it detects a running instance of the server [stegru/gpii-iod](https://github.com/stegru/gpii-iod) somewhere on
the network then that will be used instead.
