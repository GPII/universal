pilot2.json
=================

MM set up to run as a matchmaker proxy supporting 3 matchmakers:
* ruleBased: expected to run at rbmm.gpii.net
* statistical: expected to run at stmm.gpii.net
* flat: local instance of the flat matchmaker on port 8079

This setup is identical to proxy.json, except for where the rulebased and statistical MM are
expected to be running
