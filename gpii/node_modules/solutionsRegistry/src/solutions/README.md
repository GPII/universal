# Solutions

A "solution" is an application or operating system feature that can be controlled by Morphic.  To control a solution,
Morphic needs enough information to:

1. Determine whether the solution is available for the operating system on which Morphic is running.
2. Determine whether the solution is installed.
3. Install the solution if needed (TODO: link to IoD work)
4. Determine whether the solution is running.
5. Start the solution if needed.
6. Configure one or more settings within the solution.
7. Stop the solution if needed (typically when a user logs out).
