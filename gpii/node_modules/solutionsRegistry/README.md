# Solutions Registry

This directory contains the raw data used to produce the "solutions registry" data used by other parts of the system.
This data describes:

1. What solutions exist.
2. How to detect whether each solution is installed.
3. How to start and stop each solution.
4. What settings the solution supports.
5. What each setting does.
6. What values are allowed for each setting.
7. How each setting relates to any "generic preference terms", so that a general preference can be expressed in multiple
   solutions.

In most cases you will not want to use the data in this directory directly.  Instead, you should use the data generated
by the scripts in this directory, which is saved to the builds subdirectory.
