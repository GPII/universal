# Solutions Registry

This directory contains the raw data used to produce the "solutions registry" data used by other parts of the system.
This data describes:

1. What solutions exist.
2. How to detect whether each solution is installed.
3. How to start and stop each solution.
4. What settings the solution supports.
5. What each setting does.
6. What values are allowed for each setting.
7. How each setting relates to any "generic preference terms", so that a general preference can be expressed in multiple
   solutions.

In most cases you will not want to use the data in this directory directly.  Instead, you should use the data generated
by the scripts in this directory, which is saved to the builds subdirectory.  This data is generated by scanning both
the "solutions" and "generic preference terms" contained in their respective subdirectories.  See each of their entries
below for more details.

## Solutions

A "solution" is an application (or portion of the operating system) that can be controlled by Morphic.

The `src/solutions` subdirectory contains the individual definitions for each supported solution.  By convention, these
are organised into sub-folders by manufacturer.   For example, the definition for the solution JAWS can be found in the
file `jaws.json5` in the `src/solutions/com.freedomscientific` subdirectory.  See the
[README file in the solutions directory](./src/solutions/README.md) for more details.

## Generic Preference Terms

A "generic preference term" (sometimes also called a "common term") is not associated with a particular application.
Instead, it is a means of expressing a preference that should be applied across a range of solutions.  For example,
you might want for subtitles to be turned on wherever available.  The preference
`http://registry.gpii.net/common/subtitles/enabled` will be transformed into application-specific settings that
will configure each individual application to enable subtitles.

The `src/terms` subdirectory contains the individual definitions for each supported generic preference term.

See the [README file in the solutions directory](./src/terms/README.md) for more details.
