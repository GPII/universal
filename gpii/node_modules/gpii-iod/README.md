# Install on Demand

Provides the ability to install software based on the requirements of a user.

[Technical Design](https://tinyurl.com/y7xhcghu) (google doc)

## Operation

### GPII Start

* IoD server is detected using mDNS (or configured server, or local datasource)
* Package list is taken from the IoD server.
* Installation information about packages that *GPII* has installed but not removed, is loaded (if any).
  * These packages are uninstalled.

### Key-in

Current implementation is a hack which uses a launch handler to invoke `gpii.iod.requirePackage`.

The stages of installation:

* Get the package info from the server.
* `requirePackage` finds a suitable `gpii.iod.packageInstaller` for the type package.
* Package file is downloaded from the URI in the package info.
* The installer component installs the package:
  * chocolatey: Windows service is instructed to run `choco install`.
* Installation info is stored to disk to survive reboot.
* Package file is removed.

### Key-out

* If the key-out is due to another user logging in, then wait for the next key-out.
* The installer component uninstalls the package.
  * chocolatey: Windows service is instructed to run `choco uninstall`.
* If successful, installation info file is removed.
* If failed, the package is uninstalled when GPII starts again.

## Parts

### `gpii.iod`

The install on demand component.

### `gpii.iod.packages`

### `gpii.iod.packageInstaller`

Base component of the package installers, which perform the work that's specific to the type of package being installed.
Implementations will probably be found in the OS-specific repository.

This performs the initialise->cleanup pipeline.

### `gpii.iod.packageDataSource`

The package data source.

## Packages

Packages consist of a `packageInfo` json file, and the package file. Support can be provided for different types of
packages, however chocolatey already does a good job at wrapping other installer types.

```javascript
/**
 * @typedef {Object} packageInfo
 * @property {string} name - The package name.
 * @property {string} url - The package location (optional, to override the IoD server with an external location).
 * @property {string} filename - The package filename.
 * @property {string} packageType - Type of installer to use.
 * @property {string} hash - The signed hash of the package.
 */
packageInfo = {
    name: "some-package",
    url: "https://iod-server.example.com/some-package",
    filename: "some-package.1.0.0.nupkg",
    packageType: "chocolatey"
};
```

### Multi-lingual packages

Multiple languages can be supported in a single package, like so:

```json
{
    "name": "another-package",
    "url": "https://example.com/default-language",
    "languages": {
        "en-GB": {
            "url": "https://example.com/real-english"
        },
        "es": {
            "url": "https://example.com/general-spanish"
        },
        "es-ES": {
            "url": "https://example.com/spain-spanish"
        },
        "es-MX": {
            "url": "https://example.com/mexican-spanish"
        }
    }
}
```

When a package is requested, a language may be specified. The package can contain a `languages` field which contains
the language-specific fields for each supported language, which over-write the fields in the root.

In the example above, all languages shall use the root values unless the requested language is British English, in that
case the `en-GB` block is used, or any type of Spanish. Spanish from Spain or Mexico would use the block that specific
to those countries (`es-ES` or `es-MX`), any other Spanish dialect will use the generic `es` block.

## IoD Server

Using the development config, GPII will provide package data from [testData/installOnDemand](../../../testData/installOnDemand).

But, if it detects a running instance of the server [stegru/gpii-iod](https://github.com/stegru/gpii-iod) somewhere on
the network then that will be used instead.
