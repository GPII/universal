GPII Personalization Framework: Test Framework
======================================================

This module sets up the framework required for testing, and should generally be used when writing tests for the GPII.

- For tests run using nodejs, this framework should be included as a require
- For tests run in the browser, relevant files need to be referenced (via script src and link rel). These would be:

testFramework/web/third-party/qunit/css/qunit.css
testFramework/web/third-party/jquery/js/jquery.js
testFramework/web/js/gpiiTestsExports.js
testFramework/web/third-party/qunit/js/qunit.js
testFramework/web/third-party/jqunit/js/jqUnit.js
