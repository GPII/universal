Journal
===

The Journal component is responsible for Journalling the state of the system's settings
in order to be able to recover from system crashes or corruption of the settings state.

The Journal determines a GPII base directory to write the journal in, which is a subdirectory
of the user's settings directory named "gpii". The user's settings directory is determined
by a system dependent algorithm - 

* On Windows, the directory is determined by the environment variable APPDATA, as recommended
by Microsoft at https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/patricka/2010/03/18/where-should-i-store-my-data-and-configuration-files-if-i-target-multiple-os-versions/
* On every other platform, it uses the value of the node standard API [`os.homedir`](https://nodejs.org/api/os.html#os_os_homedir)
