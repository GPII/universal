gpii.pouchManager.config.base.json
==================================

This config acts as a base for `gpii.config.cloudBased.development.all.local`.
It includes configs to instantiate:
* A PouchDB express server as a storage for GPII Authorization Server
* An express server to reset the PouchDB to its initial state

Note that PouchDB is only used when GPII runs in the development mode. When GPII runs in the production mode, CouchDB is used instead.
