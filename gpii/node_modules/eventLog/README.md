# GPII Event Log

Produces logs that can be read by a backend server for analysis and auditing. The log is in JSON format, and stored in
a file for an external process to send to the backend.

Rather than transforming the fluid.log output, this module was produced so the debug log is still usable by humans and
it serves as a way of opting-in to sending only useful (and non-private) information.
