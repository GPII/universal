 *
 * The current criteria for validity is that the item is not undefined and has
 * the `type` that is supplied in the arguments.
 *
 * @param  {Object} item - Item, mostly a return from another API or CouchDB call
 * that we are checking to make sure it's of the appropriate type.
 * @param  {String} type - The `type` that the item should be of. This is to
 * follow the convention we have for CouchDB records where each record has a `type`
 * member.
 * @param  {String} errorMessage - If this isn't the appropriate type, this message will be
 * included in the promise rejection payload.
 * @return {fluid.promise} Promise, when the item is valid is resolves with the
 * original item. When the item is not valid, it rejects with an error payload including
 * the supplied `errorMessage`.
