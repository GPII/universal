production.with.logging.json
==========================

This configuration runs the system in production mode, but keeps the logging enabled. It refers to both the remote matchmakers and preferences server and uses the dynamic device reporter. The following services are expected to be available when using this configuration:

* http://preferences.gpii.net - the preferences server
* http://rbmm.gpii.net - the rule based matchmaker
* http://stmm.gpii.net - the statistical matchmaker

* The following components are running on the local machine:
** flowManager
** OntologyHandler
** solutionsRegistry (reading registry from file)
** deviceReporter (dynamic mode)
** matchMakerFramework
** flatMatchMaker
** lifecycleManager

**THIS CONFIGURATION IS NOT REGULARLY TESTED AND CANNOT BE TRUSTED TO WORK**
It has been created for the year 4 reviews of C4A and will be tested in that connection, but it currently does not have any test-coverage via acceptance or integration tests.
