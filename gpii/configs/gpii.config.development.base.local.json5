/**
 * This configuration acts as a base for `gpii.config.development.local` and `gpii.config.development.dynamicDR.local`.
 * It includes configs to locate the local flow manager, the cloud based flow manager, the preferences server and
 * matchmaker all locally. The extra work required is to arrange to cross-inject the ontology handler between the
 * matchmaker and preferences server.
 *
 * * The following components are running:
 * ** Auth Server
 * ** Flat MatchMaker
 * ** Cloud Based Flow Manager
 * ** Local Flow Manager
 * ** MatchMaker Framework
 * ** Ontology Handler
 * ** Preferences Server
 * ** Solutions Registry (reading registry from file)
