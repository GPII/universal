gpii.config.all.development.dr.production.json
==============================================

This configuration runs the entire system locally and in development mode with the exception of the deviceReporter,
which runs in production mode.

This mean that:
* All storage is on the local filesystem (as opposed to couchDB servers/remote URLs)
* The following components are running on the local machine:
** flowManager
** preferencesServer
** OntologyHandler
** rawPreferencesServer (reading preferences from file)
** solutionsRegistry (reading registry from file)
** deviceReporter (using a dynamic device reporter)
** matchMakerFramework
** canopyMatchMaker
** lifecycleManager

Notes on testing:
This setup is used as a basis for the platform specific acceptance tests that make use of a dynamic device reporter.
