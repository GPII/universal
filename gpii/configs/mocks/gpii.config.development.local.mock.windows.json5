 * This configuration runs the entire system, in the "trusted local FlowManager" configuration, locally and in development mode.
 * This configuration is used for testing PSP channel, which means that the fetch of solutions is sourced from the filesystem,
 * and the preferences are fetched from a CouchDB instance that is created if needed and provisioned at the start of
 * each test sequence.
