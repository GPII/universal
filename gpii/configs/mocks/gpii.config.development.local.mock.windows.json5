 * A variety of gpii.config.development.local.json5 which supplies mock implementations of all settings handlers

 *
 * This configuration runs the entire system, in the "trusted local FlowManager" configuration, locally and in development mode.
 * This configuration is used for testing PSP channel, which means that the fetch of solutions is sourced from the filesystem,
 * and the fetch of preferences is sourced from the pouchDB that is constructed at the start of each test sequence and demolished
 * at the end of each test sequence.
