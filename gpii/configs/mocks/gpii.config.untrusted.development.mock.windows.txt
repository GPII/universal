gpii.config.cloudBased.development.all.local.mock.windows.json
=================================================

A variant of gpii.cloudBased.development.all.local which includes mock definitions for all builtin settings handlers
supported on the Windows platform. This allows any preference set to be logged in from a bare universal repo without
crashing the system.

This configuration runs the entire system as a cloudBased flowmanager, but with everything locally and in development mode.

This mean that:
* The storage for user preferences is on the local filesystem (as opposed to couchDB servers/remote URLs)
* The storage for the authentication data is stored locally in a pouchDB
* The following components are running on the local machine:
** flowManager
** preferencesServer
** OntologyHandler
** rawPreferencesServer (reading preferences from file)
** solutionsRegistry (reading registry from file)
** canopyMatchMaker
** matchMakerFramework

Note that this config incorrectly derives from the deviceReporter development config. This is because of a dependency error in the system design where the cloudBased flowManager still attempts to query the platform deviceReporter rather than recognising that it is on platform "web" - e.g. within BrowserChannel.js
