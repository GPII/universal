 * A variety of gpii.config.development.all.local.json which supplies mock implementations of all settings handlers

 * This configuration runs the entire system, in the "trusted local FlowManager" configuration, locally and in development mode.
 * This means that fetches of solutions, preferences, etc. are sourced from the filesystem rather than from CouchDB URLs.
