Mock Configs
============

This directory contains variants of the configs in the outer directory, with the settings handler definitions replaced by mocks. 
This makes them suitable for testing from the bare universal repository, without the risk of failures caused by 
missing platform-specific settings handlers, or any corruption to the outer machine's state.
