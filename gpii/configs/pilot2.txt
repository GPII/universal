pilot2.json
============

Configuration file to be used for the second round of pilots in the CLOUD4All project.

It is set up to use:
* The multiple matchmaker configuration (ie. pointing to the online matchmakers)
* Does NOT start a local preferences server
* Everything else is started locally
* The "pilot2" config of the flowmanager -
** see universal/gpii/node_modules/flowmanager/configs/pilot2.txt
** Roughly speaking that config expects everything to run locally except for the remote prefs server
