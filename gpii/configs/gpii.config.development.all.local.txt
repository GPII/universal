gpii.config.development.all.local.json
======================================

This configuration runs the entire system locally and in development mode.

This mean that:
* All storage is on the local filesystem (as opposed to couchDB servers/remote URLs)
* The following components are running on the local machine:
** flowManager
** preferencesServer
** OntologyHandler
** rawPreferencesServer (reading preferences from file)
** solutionsRegistry (reading registry from file)
** deviceReporter (reading device context info from file)
** matchMakerFramework
** canopyMatchMaker
** lifecycleManager

Notes on testing:
This setup is used as a basis for the platform specific acceptance tests. Since the acceptance tests might use slightly different paths for the tests (i.e. a special folder for reading prefs and solutionsRegistry),
what is actually being used for testing is a slight variation of this config. For more details, see the txt files describing the configs in the acceptance tests folder of both universal and the platform specific repositories.
