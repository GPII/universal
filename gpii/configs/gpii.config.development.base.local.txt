gpii.config.development.base.local.json
=======================================

This config acts as a base for `gpii.config.development.all.local` and `gpii.config.all.development.dr.production`.
It includes configs to locate the flow manager, preferences server and matchmaker all locally. The extra
work required is to arrange to cross-inject the ontology handler between the matchmaker and preferences server.
