== gpii.config.cloudBased.production ==

Runs the entire system  in cloudBased flowmanager production mode. 
This means that only the services relevant to the cloudBased flowmanager will be started up, EXCLUDING the preferences server, which is expected to be running on the `http://preferences.gpii.net` URL.
NOTE - THIS CONFIG NEEDS TO BE REPAIRED following the GPII-1318 merge
