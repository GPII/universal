production.with.logging.json
==========================

This configuration runs the system in production mode, but keeps the logging enabled. 'production mode' means that the following services are expected to be available:

* http://stmm.gpii.net - the statistical matchmaker
* http://rbmm.gpii.net - the rule based matchmaker
* http://preferences.gpii.net - the preferences server

* The following components are running on the local machine:
** flowManager
** OntologyHandler
** solutionsRegistry (reading registry from file)
** deviceReporter (reading device context info from file)
** matchMakerFramework
** flatMatchMaker
** lifecycleManager

**WARNING: This config has been tested manually leading up to and during the review meeting (Jan. 2015).
It is NOT regularly tested by acceptance/integration or unit tests and therefore cannot be fully trusted.**
