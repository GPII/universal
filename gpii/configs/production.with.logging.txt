production.with.logging.json
==========================

This configuration runs the system in production mode, but keeps the logging enabled. 'production mode' means that the following services are expected to be available:

* http://preferences.gpii.net - the preferences server

Also, the Device Reporter runs in production mode (ie. detecting what's on they system rather than getting installed applications from a file)

* The following components are running on the local machine:
** flowManager
** OntologyHandler
** solutionsRegistry (reading registry from file)
** deviceReporter (dynamic mode)
** matchMakerFramework
** flatMatchMaker
** lifecycleManager
