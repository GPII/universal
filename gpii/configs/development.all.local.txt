development.all.local.json
==========================

This configuration runs the entire system locally and in development mode.

This mean that:
* All storage is on the local filesystem (as opposed to couchDB servers/remote URLs)
* The following components are running on the local machine:
** flowManager
** preferencesFramework
** OntologyHandler
** rawPreferencesServer (reading preferences from file)
** solutionsRegistry (reading registry from file)
** deviceReporter (reading device context info from file)
** matchMaker
** lifecycleManagerServer
