/**
 * This configuration runs the entire system locally and in development mode.
 *
 * This mean that:
 * * All storage is on the local filesystem (as opposed to couchDB servers/remote URLs)
 * * The following components are running on the local machine:
 * ** canopyMatchMaker
 * ** deviceReporter (reading device context info from file)
 * ** flowManager
 * ** lifecycleManager
 * ** matchMakerFramework
 * ** OntologyHandler
 * ** preferencesServer
 * ** solutionsRegistry (reading registry from file)
 *
 * Notes on testing:
 * This setup is used as a basis for the platform specific acceptance tests. Since the acceptance tests might use slightly different paths for the tests (i.e. a special folder for reading prefs and solutionsRegistry),
 * what is actually being used for testing is a slight variation of this config. For more details, see the txt files describing the configs in the acceptance tests folder of both universal and the platform specific repositories.
 *
 * This setup does not run the pouch manager because acceptance tests require a special pouchDB handler (gpii.test.pouch.pouchTestCaseHolder) that performs fresh data loading and destruction at the start and the end running each test case.
