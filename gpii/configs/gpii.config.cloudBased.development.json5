/**
 * This configuration acts as a base for `gpii.config.cloudBased.development.all.local`.
 *
 * * The following components are running:
 * ** Auth Server
 * ** Canopy MatchMaker
 * ** Flow Manager
 * ** MatchMaker Framework
 * ** Ontology Handler
 * ** Preferences Server
 * ** Solutions Registry (reading registry from file)
 *
 * Notes on testing:
 * This setup is used by the acceptance tests in universal testing the cloudBased applications.
 * Each individual acceptance test may override some elements of this config, e.g. the folder
 * to be used for reading prefs and solutionsRegistry).
 * For more details, see the txt files describing the configs in the acceptance tests folder.
 *
 * This setup does not run the pouch manager because acceptance tests require a special pouchDB
 * handler (gpii.test.pouch.pouchTestCaseHolder) that uses db data for tests.
