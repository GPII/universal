/**
 * This config acts as a base for `gpii.config.cloudBased.development.all.local`.
 * It includes configs to locate these items all locally:
 *
 * ** authServer
 * ** canopyMatchMaker
 * ** flowManager
 * ** matchMakerFramework
 * ** OntologyHandler
 * ** preferencesServer
 * ** solutionsRegistry (reading registry from file)
 *
 * Notes on testing:
 * This setup is used by the acceptance tests in universal testing the cloudBased applications.
 * Each individual acceptance test may override some elements of this config, e.g. the folder
 * to be used for reading prefs and solutionsRegistry).
 * For more details, see the txt files describing the configs in the acceptance tests folder.
 *
 * This setup does not run the pouch manager because acceptance tests require a special pouchDB
 * handler (gpii.test.pouch.pouchTestCaseHolder) that uses db data for tests.
