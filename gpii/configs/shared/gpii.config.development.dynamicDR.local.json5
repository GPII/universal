/**
 * This configuration runs the entire system locally with a dynamic deviceReporter on port 8081. It expects couchDB
 * to be running separately on localhost for data persistence.
 *
 * * The following components are running:
 * ** Dynamic Device Reporter
 * ** Flow Manager
 * ** Preferences Server
 * ** Ontology Handler
 * ** Solutions Registry (reading registry from file)
 * ** MatchMaker Framework
 * ** Flat MatchMaker
 * ** Lifecycle Manager
 *
 * Notes on testing:
 * This setup is used as a basis for the platform specific acceptance tests that make use of a dynamic device reporter.
