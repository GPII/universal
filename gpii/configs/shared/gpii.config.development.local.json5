/**
 * This configuration acts as a base for `gpii.config.development.manualTesting` and many configurations used by
 * integration tests. It runs the entire system including the local flow manager, the cloud based flow manager,
 * the preferences server and matchmaker all locally. It doesn't start any backend database for data persistence.
 *
 * * The following components are running:
 * ** Auth Server
 * ** Flat MatchMaker
 * ** Cloud Based Flow Manager
 * ** Lifecycle Manager
 * ** Local Flow Manager
 * ** MatchMaker Framework
 * ** Ontology Handler
 * ** Preferences Server
 * ** Solutions Registry (reading registry from file)
 * ** Static Device Reporter (reading from file)
 *
 * Notes on testing:
 * This setup is used as a basis for the platform specific acceptance tests. Since the acceptance tests might use slightly different paths for the tests (i.e. a special folder for reading prefs and solutionsRegistry),
 * what is actually being used for testing is a slight variation of this config. For more details, see the txt files describing the configs in the acceptance tests folder of both universal and the platform specific repositories.
