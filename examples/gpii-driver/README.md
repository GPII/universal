This directory contains an example that provides customisations to the GPII by means of the "driver" pattern.

This example demonstrates how to inject a component named `gpii.app` as a subcomponent of the GPII flow manager. To start the customized GPII, simply type:

    node driver.js

from this directory. The logging information output by `gpii.app` will appear on the GPII console.
