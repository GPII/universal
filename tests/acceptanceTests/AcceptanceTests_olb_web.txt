AcceptanceTests_olb_web.js

Description:
This is a set of acceptance tests for the Online Banking demonstrator (OLB) using the Online Flow Manager. 
It relies on the following preference sets in testData\preferences\acceptanceTests:
* olb_Carla.json
* olb_KimCallahan.json
* olb_Lara.json

The first version of these tests only checks a basic transformer for "language".


Requirements: 
Since the Online Banking demonstrator uses the Online Flow Manager (or "Cloud-based Flow Manager"), there are no requirements other than a local instance of the GPII running with NODE_ENV set to "cloudBasedFlowManager".
