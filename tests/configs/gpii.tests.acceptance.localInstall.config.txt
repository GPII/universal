This configuration file is used for acceptance testing.

It uses the basic (default) development setup of the system, but replaces the 
folder with NP sets used to be (universal)/testData/preferences/acceptanceTests 
as opposed to the normal preferences folder. 
Besides that, everything will be based on the normal development mode setup.

The name "localInstall" refers to a setup where GPII is running as installed 
locally on the machine (as opposed to eg. running the system as a cloudBased flowmanager).

This file is used as a "base config" by architecture-specific tests in the windows 
and linux repositories, as well as locally as the base for universal integration tests.
