This configuration file is used for acceptance testing.

It uses the basic (default) development setup of the system, with a couple of
modifications.  It replaces the folder with NP sets in (universal)/testData/preferences/acceptanceTests
as opposed to the normal preferences folder.  It also uses the dynamic device
reporter (the device reporter in production mode).  Otherwise, everything else
is based on the normal development mode setup.

The name "localInstall" refers to a setup where GPII is running as installed 
locally on the machine (as opposed to eg. running the system as a cloudBased flowmanager).

This file is used as a "base config" by architecture-specific tests in the windows 
and linux repositories, as well as locally as the base for universal integration tests.
