This config file is used for integration and acceptance tests on Linux as well as the context integration tests

It includes to the basic localInstall setup for acceptance tests (modifying the
preferences folder used), which in turn includes the standard development
config file (running GPII locally, using development setup).

This config sets the device reporter file to be 'linux_builtIn.json', which will
report only the standard built in solutions as installed.
