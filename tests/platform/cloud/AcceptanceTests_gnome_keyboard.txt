AcceptanceTests_gnome_keyboard.js

Description:
This is an example of a tests using the cloud based flow manager. It relies on the 'fm_gnome_keyboard.json' preferences set in the testData/preferences/acceptanceTests/ folder. Since the gnome keyboard doesn't support talking directly to the cloudbased flowmanager, etc., this testcase is strictly meant as an example of how a cloudbased acceptance test can be written (using gnome keyboard as an example) - and as a confrimation that the cloudBased flowmanager (running locally with the given setup) works.

Requirements:
Since it's using the cloud based flow manager, there are NO REQUIREMENTS to the system other than the GPII being installed (and able to run in local 'cloudBased' flowmanager mode).
