AcceptanceTests_smarthouses.js

Description:
This is the acceptanceTests for the cloudBased solution 'net.gpii.smarthouses', which is a simulation of a smarthouse using the GPII.

It uses the 'smarthouse1' and 'smarthouse2' NP sets which contains different common term preferences.

Requirements:
Since it's using the online flowmanager, there are NO REQUIREMENTS to the system other than the GPII being installed (and able to run in local 'cloudBased' flowmanager mode).
