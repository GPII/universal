AcceptanceTests_jme.js

Description:
This is the acceptanceTests for the cloudBased solution 'info.cloud4all.JME'.
This solution is used by simple phones that have the Cloud4allThemes application
installed on them to make use of the GPII.
It uses the 'fm_jme_common' NP set which contains a set of common-terms
settings.

Requirements:
Since it's using the online flowmanager, there are NO REQUIREMENTS to the system
other than the GPII being installed (and able to run in local 'cloudBased'
flowmanager mode.
