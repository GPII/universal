To be more specific it:
* Runs a "cloudBased flowmanager" on the local machine
* is based on (includes) the "cloudbased" config of gpii and flowmanager
* is based on (includes) the standard "development" config of the preferences server
* Runs the all the required services (incl. MMs and prefs server) locally
* Uses the preference sets from the testData/preferences/acceptanceTests/ folder
