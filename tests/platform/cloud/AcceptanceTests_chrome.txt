AcceptanceTests_chrome.js

Description:
This is an series of tests using the online flowmanager.

These tests use the testDefinitions from AcceptanceTests_chrome_testDefs.json (which are also shared with the chrome_oauth2 tests)

Three N&P sets have been created in order to test the different transformations between the common terms and the clouc4all specific settings:
* chrome_font_size tests the transformation from a numeric value in the common terms to an enumeration value ("medium", "large", "x-large")
* chrome_magnification tests the transformation from a double value (1.2) to an integer (1, 2 or 3)
* chrome_high_contrast tests if the high contrast themes are correctly set.

Requirements:
Since it's using the online flowmanager, there are NO REQUIREMENTS to the system other than the GPII being installed (and able to run in local 'cloudBased' flowmanager mode).
