This config file is used for integration and acceptance tests on Android.

It includes to the basic localInstall setup for acceptance tests (modifying the

config file (running GPII locally, using development setup).

This config sets the device reporter file to be 'android_builtIn.json', which will
report only the standard built in solutions as installed.
