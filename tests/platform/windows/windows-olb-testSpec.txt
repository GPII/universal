windows-olb-testSpec.js

Description:
This is a set of acceptance tests for the Online Banking demonstrator (OLB) using the Online Flow Manager. 
It relies on the following preference sets in ..\..\testData\preferences\acceptanceTests:
* olb_Carla.json
* olb_KimCallahan.json
* olb_Lara.json

The first version of these tests only checks a basic transformer for "language".


Requirements: 
Since the Online Banking demonstrator uses the Online Flow Manager (or "Cloud-based Flow Manager"), there are no requirements other than a local instance of the GPII running with NODE_ENV set to "cloudBased.development.all.local" and starting the server from the "universal" folder by typing "node node_modules/kettle/lib/init.js gpii/configs/".
Note:
Using the Online Flow Manager is a temporary workaround until there is infrastructure that allows web applications to request settings through the local Flow Manager.
