windows-jaws-testSpec.js

Descriptions:
This will run the acceptance tests for the JAWS screenreader (Freedom Scientific). It uses 2 NP sets: jaws_common.json, jaws_common2.json, jaws_common3.json and jaws_application.json

Prerequisites:
* JAWS needs to be installed
* In JAWS, a profile should be created by going to "options"->voices->Voice Adjustment. Make sure that "Eloquence - (factory)" is selected in the profile name. Click "Save As.." button and write "GPII" as the name (no quotes). Once this is done, Jaws should be working properly
* Alternative: Create two empty files:
  C:\Users\user\AppData\Roaming\Freedom Scientific\JAWS\17.0\Settings\VoiceProfiles\GPII.VPF
  C:\Users\user\AppData\Roaming\Freedom Scientific\JAWS\17.0\Settings\enu\DEFAULT.JCF

Tested with JAWS 17.0
