This configuration file is used by the acceptance test: AcceptanceTests_builtIn.js.

It uses the basic (default) development setup of the system, with a couple of
modifications.  It replaces the folder with NP sets in (universal)/testData/preferences/acceptanceTests
as opposed to the normal preferences folder.  It also uses the dynamic device
reporter (the device reporter in production mode).  Otherwise, everything else
is based on the normal development mode setup.
