This configuration file is used by the acceptance tests for Read&Write Gold

It includes the basic localInstall setup for acceptance tests (modifying the preferences folder used), which in turn includes the standard development config file (running GPII locally, using development setup).

This config sets the device reporter file to be 'readWrite.json', which will report Read&Write Gold as being installed on the system.
