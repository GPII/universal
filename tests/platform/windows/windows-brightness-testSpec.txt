windows-brightness-testSpec.js

Description:
This tests the Windows 10 built in functionality brightness, this feature is hardware
dependent and isn't available in VMs, so it is isolated in its own file.

Requirements:

* Being on a windows 10 machine.
* Having a screen which allows changing its brightness by software.
* Having compatible graphics hardware.

As long as the system is able to change brightness using the system interface,
this feature should be available in that system, and tests could be exercised there.
