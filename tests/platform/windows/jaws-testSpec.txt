AcceptanceTests_jaws.js

Descriptions:
This will run the acceptance tests for the JAWS screenreader (Freedom Scientific). It uses 2 NP sets: jaws_common.json and jaws_application.json

Prerequisites:
* JAWS needs to be installed
* In JAWS, a profile should be created by going to "options"->voices->Voice Adjustment. Make sure that "Eloquence - (factory)" is selected in the profile name. Click "Save As.." button and write "cloud4all" as the name (no quotes). Once this is done, Jaws should be working properly

Has been tested with JAWS 15.0
