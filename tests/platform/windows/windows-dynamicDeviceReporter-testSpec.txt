windows-dynamicDeviceReporter-testSpec.js

Descriptions:

This will run the acceptance tests with dynamic device reporting.
It uses 2 preference sets: screenreader_nvda and readwritegold_application1.

Due to some current limitations/issues with the current flat matchmaker, JAWS
should not be installed, and sociable should not be listed as installed, because
they will both attempt to launch with an NVDA NP.

Requirements:
* NVDA installed
* Read and Write Gold not installed

To run these tests, you need to have NVDA INSTALLED. NVDA is free and can be downloaded from: http://www.nvaccess.org/download/
